<h1>Locksim</h1>

<b>Locksim</b> is a simulator for database locking,
to try out various locking methods such as two-phase locking.
It supports multiple transactions and both binary and read/write locks.



<h2>Usage</h2>

A <b>scenario</b> with database data and specification of the transactions is
written in a text file. Then <b>locksim</b> is started using the command line:

<blockquote>
<pre>
locksim  SCENARIO-FILE  REPS</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<b>SCENARIO-FILE</b> is the name of the scenario file.
<b>REPS</b>, which is optional, is the number of times to run the scenario.



<h2>An example scenario</h2>

Lotta and Kalle are friends.
They have some money in their bank accounts, and both of them want to give
away their money to the other person.
Here is a scenario file called <b>swap.txt</b>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Lotta = 100;
Kalle = 50;

transaction T1 {
    Read(Lotta);
    Gift = Lotta;
    Lotta = 0;
    Write(Lotta);
    Read(Kalle);
    Kalle = Kalle + Gift;
    Write(Kalle);
}

transaction T2 {
    Read(Kalle);
    Gift = Kalle;
    Kalle = 0;
    Write(Kalle);
    Read(Lotta);
    Lotta = Lotta + Gift;
    Write(Lotta);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

The database contains two data objects, the variables <b>Lotta</b> and <b>Kalle</b>,
which are the balances of two bank accounts belonging to Lotta and Kalle.
In transaction <b>T1</b> Lotta gives away her money to Kalle.
In transaction <b>T2</b> Kalle gives away his money to Lotta.

<p>

Some explanations of the commands in the file:

<ul>
<li>
The command <b>Read(X)</b> reads the data item <b>X</b> from the database,
and puts a copy in a transaction-local variable also called <b>X</b>.

<li>
The command <b>Write(X)</b> writes to the data item <b>X</b> in the database,
copying the value from a transaction-local variable also called <b>X</b>.

<li>
When the command <b>X = 17</b> is used inside a transaction,
it sets the transaction-local variable <b>X</b> to the value <b>17</b>.

<li>
When the command <b>X = 17</b> is used <i>before</i> any transactions,
it creates a data item called <b>X</b> in the database,
and sets it to the value <b>17</b>.

</ul>

<p>

If the transactions are run serially, or in a serializable schedule,
one person ends up with all the money, and the other none.
Either Kalle will first give all his money to Lotta, and Lotta will then give all the money to Kalle,
so Kalle ends up with all the money and Lotta none,
or Lotta will first give all her money to Kalle, and Kalle will then give all the money to Lotta,
so Lotta ends up with all the money and Kalle none,

<p>

We run the scenario one million times with this command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
locksim swap.txt 1000000
</pre>
</blockquote>

Since the two transactions concurrently modify the variables without locking,
we can get some unexpected results.
Here is the output from Locksim:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Tried the scenario in 'swap.txt' 1000000 times.
There were 7 different results:
7784 times: 2 variables: Lotta = 150, Kalle = 0
7872 times: 2 variables: Lotta = 0, Kalle = 150
190597 times: 2 variables: Lotta = 150, Kalle = 100
192107 times: 2 variables: Lotta = 50, Kalle = 150
163713 times: 2 variables: Lotta = 50, Kalle = 0
273673 times: 2 variables: Lotta = 50, Kalle = 100
164254 times: 2 variables: Lotta = 0, Kalle = 100
</pre>
</blockquote>

To avoid these concurrency problems, we can add locking.
Here we have used two-phase locking with read/write locks:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Lotta = 100;
Kalle = 50;

transaction Lotta {
    ReadLock(Lotta);
    Read(Lotta);
    Gift = Lotta;
    Lotta = 0;
    WriteLock(Lotta);
    Write(Lotta);
    ReadLock(Kalle);
    Read(Kalle);
    Kalle = Kalle + Gift;
    WriteLock(Kalle);
    Unlock(Lotta);
    Write(Kalle);
    Unlock(Kalle);
}

transaction Kalle {
    ReadLock(Kalle);
    Read(Kalle);
    Gift = Kalle;
    Kalle = 0;
    WriteLock(Kalle);
    Write(Kalle);
    ReadLock(Lotta);
    Read(Lotta);
    Lotta = Lotta + Gift;
    WriteLock(Lotta);
    Unlock(Kalle);
    Write(Lotta);
    Unlock(Lotta);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

Some explanations of the locking commands:

<ul>

<li>
<b>ReadLock(X)</b> requests a shared lock for the data item <b>X</b> in the database.
If some other transaction has an exclusive lock, <b>X</b> can not be locked,
and this transaction will wait until it gets the lock.
If this transaction already had an exclusive lock on <b>X</b>, it is downgraded to a shared lock.
If this transaction already had a shared lock on <b>X</b>, nothing happens.

<li>
<b>WriteLock(X)</b> requests an exclusive lock for the data item <b>X</b> in the database.
If some other transaction has an exclusive or shared lock, <b>X</b> can not be locked,
and this transaction will wait until it gets the lock.
If this transaction already had a shared lock on <b>X</b>, it is upgraded to a shared lock (or the transaction waits).
If this transaction already had an exclusive lock on <b>X</b>, nothing happens.

<li>
<b>Unlock(X)</b> releases the shared or exclusive lock that this transaction has for the data item <b>X</b> in the database.
If this transaction doesn't have lock on <b>X</b>, nothing happens.

<li>
<b>Lock(X)</b> is a synonym for <b>WriteLock(X)</b>.

</ul>

<p>

Now the output from Locksim looks like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Tried the scenario in 'swap-rw-2PL'.txt 1000000 times.
There were 5 different results:
995 times: 2 variables: Lotta = 150, Kalle = 0
966 times: 2 variables: Lotta = 0, Kalle = 150
273976 times: *** Deadlock! *** 2 variables: Lotta = 0, Kalle = 50
*** Deadlock! ***
272769 times: *** Deadlock! *** 2 variables: Lotta = 100, Kalle = 0
*** Deadlock! ***
451294 times: *** Deadlock! *** 2 variables: Lotta = 0, Kalle = 0
*** Deadlock! ***
</pre>
</blockquote>

As we can see, sometimes our locking schema leads to deadlock,
but when the scenario is finished without deadlock,
we get only the two expected results.



<h2>Some notes</h2>

<ul>

<li>
Since this is a locking simulator and not a scheduler,
you can create all sorts of strange and incorrect locking schemes.

<li>
Locking is discretionary.
If a transaction doesn't request a lock on a variable,
it can still accesses it.

<li>
If a transaction still has locks when it ends, those locks will not be released until the scenario ends.

</ul>
